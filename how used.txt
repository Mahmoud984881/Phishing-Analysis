The SUPER PHISHING EMAIL ANALYZER v3.1 is a tool designed to analyze suspicious emails for phishing indicators. Here's what it does:

Core Functions:
Extracts Key Indicators:

IP Addresses: Identifies sender/server IPs (e.g., 45.156.231.138).

URLs: Detects obfuscated links (e.g., hxxps://amazon[.]zzyuchengzhika[.]cn), decoding them to reveal malicious destinations.

Headers: Parses metadata like From, To, Subject, and authentication headers (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).

Authentication Checks:

Validates email legitimacy using SPF (sender IP verification), DKIM (signature checks), and DMARC (domain alignment). Flags spoofed emails (e.g., "Potentially Spoofed").

Attachment Analysis:

If the email contains attachments, the tool extracts cryptographic hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) of the files. These hashes can be used to check malware databases for known threats.

Example Scenario:
In the provided email analysis:

IPs like 45.156.231.138 and URLs masked with [,] or hxxps were flagged.

Headers revealed a spoofed "From" address (amazon@zyevantoby.cn) and failed DMARC alignment.

No attachments were found, but if present, the tool would list their hashes (e.g., SHA-256: a1b2c3...).

To use the tool put the email file in the same directory and use this line:
./dist/phishing_analyzer
